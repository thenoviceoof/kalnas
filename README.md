KALNAS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A NAS system designed to fit within the KALLAX bookshelves from IKEA.

[Design blog post](http://thenoviceoof.com/blog/projects/kalnas/)

WARNING: this design has never actually been made/put
together. However, all the designs were about to be sent out for
fabrication, so it *might* only require minor tweaks.

Example minor tweak: a remaining open question is how exactly to
connect the drive bays to the frame. The plan was to 3d print a nut
that fit within the T-slots and then screw the drive bays into
that. The nut has not been designed.

80/20 Dimensions/parts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The latest version uses 1 inch 80/20 struts as a frame. As planned,
everything has end taps, so you can screw directly into the ends of
the struts.

- 4x 284.2mm. Vertical struts.

- 2x 339.2mm, access holes at 55.95, 109.45mm. Front-to-back strut,
  top.

- 2x 339.2mm, access holes at 55.95, 109.45, 226.5mm. Front-to-back
  strut, bottom. The extra holes are to accomodate a bar to support
  the PSU.

- 9x 160mm. Side-to-side struts, both for the external frame (4x) and
  internal supports for the PSU and drive bays (5x).

- 8x corner brackets
  ([McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/#47065t244/=17iepme),
